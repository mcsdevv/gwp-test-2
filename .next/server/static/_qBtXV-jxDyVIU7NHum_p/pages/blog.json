Integrating a plan to host your event virtually if circumstances demand it should be a mandatory part of the overall planning process. Organizers should have the technology in place so they can easily &#8220;turn it on&#8221; when needed. Even if the event does go off as planned, live and in-person, consider adding online aspects to increase engagement. The option to create streaming video should become an essential event utility like electricity or WiFi.</p>\n<p>While social distancing may have accelerated the acceptance of online events, webinars, in particular, are not a new concept in the federal market. Market Connections&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.marketconnectionsinc.com/fmms2019study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Media &amp; Marketing Study</a> (FMMS) found that three-quarters of federal workers reported watching live webinars during the workday and at least one in five were watching recorded webinars on their own time (weeknights and weekends). Webinars tend to be mainly one-way communication &#8211; with a speaker presenting and time for questions at the end. Frequently, the Q&amp;A is not done &#8220;live,&#8221; rather questions are gathered via messaging, vetted, and asked by the host. However, as our collective comfort with platforms like Zoom, WebEx, and Skype grow, future webinars could become more interactive, allowing for video participation and interaction between speakers and participants.</p>\n","excerpt":"We've written quite a bit about virtual events and webinars.

This approach focuses cyber defense strategies on <a href=\"https://www.meritalk.com/articles/embarking-on-the-zero-trust-journey-a-guide-for-agencies/\">safeguarding individual resources</a> and data. This is a departure from traditional network defense strategies that aimed to keep the “bad guys” out of systems. Security posture has long shifted from a position of<strong><em> if</em></strong> someone gets in to <strong><em>when</em></strong> someone gets in so it’s only logical that the overall way we defend networks changes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2019 NIST issued the <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207-draft.pdf\">Zero Trust Architecture Draft</a> that provides guidance on how agencies can implement security practices and technology that operate from a never trust, always verify stance, ensuring data is only being accessed by those who need it when they need it. While this guidance is applicable across federal as well as state and local markets, there are some unique differences in how federal and state &amp; local agencies need to approach their cyber strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Federal level, efforts are underway to make FedRAMP authorization <a href=\"https://gcn.com/articles/2019/12/17/fedramp-oscal.aspx?admgarea=TC_SecCybersSec\">more streamlined</a>, helping agencies to integrate modern cloud technologies securely. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.govevents.com/blog/2019/10/16/cdm-concentrating-on-the-how-of-cybersecurity/\">Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation</a> (CDM) program, run out of the Department of Homeland Security, is working to expand its impact across government by <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/ideas/2019/12/state-continuous-diagnostics-and-mitigation/162042/\">changing the perspective</a> by which agencies identify what is on the network, who is on the network, what is happening on the network, and how agency data is protected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State and Local technology executives are focused less on overarching guidance (akin to FedRAMP and CDM) and are concentrating on user behavior. Identity attacks, where a hacker gains use of legitimate credentials, are on the rise. <a href=\"https://gcn.com/articles/2019/12/23/state-local-identity-attacks.aspx?admgarea=TC_SecCybersSec\">One report showed</a> that these attacks (carried out by phishing tactics) are up 70%. To counteract this, state and local organizations are redoubling efforts to train their workforce, and the community at large, to identify potential phishing attacks. Preventing phishing attacks can cut down greatly on the very real threat of <a href=\"https://gcn.com/articles/2019/12/19/ransomware-defense.aspx?admgarea=TC_SecCybersSec\">ransomware</a>, where access to systems is blocked and data compromise is threatened unless money is paid to the hacker group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a quick snapshot of the cybersecurity landscape. There are some great resources on the site that dive into these (and other topics) at greater depth:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/solutions/pdfs/how-govt-agencies-are-facing-cyber-security-challenges.pdf\">How Government Agencies are Facing Cybersecurity Challenges </a>&#8212; Published by Mandiant, this paper details the four new strategies the government is using to secure its sensitive information and protect its vital infrastructure: proactive cyber threat hunting; increased use and sharing of cyber intelligence data; continuous security monitoring, with an emphasis on boundary protection and security event lifecycle management; and automation and orchestration of security operations.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity/content-hub/strengthening-state-cybersecurity?SilentAuth=1\">From Policy to Practice: Strengthening Cybersecurity in State Governments</a> &#8212; In this paper, Microsoft discusses best practices for state governments&#8217; digital transformation including policy and practice recommendations.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://ics.kaspersky.com/media/2018-Kaspersky-ICS-Whitepaper.pdf\">The State of Industrial Cybersecurity 2018 </a>&#8212; This study looks at the impact that the growing connection to things (IoT) and previously unconnected assets has on the overall security strategy and plans for organizations.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://duo.com/assets/ebooks/achieving-zero-trust-security-in-a-federal-agency.pdf\">Achieving Zero-Trust Security in Federal Agencies</a> &#8212; This paper looks at four methods agencies can use to achieve zero trust, continuous authentication, device assessments, user controls, and application access.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few of the great resources available to help better understand and plan for the cyber threat landscape.
